//! # Background Jobs
//!
//! This crate provides tooling required to run some processes asynchronously from a usually
//! synchronous application. The standard example of this is Web Services, where certain things
//! need to be processed, but processing them while a user is waiting for their browser to respond
//! might not be the best experience.
//!
//! ### Usage
//! #### Add Background Jobs to your project
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! actix-rt = "2.6.0"
//! anyhow = "1.0"
//! background-jobs = "0.15.0"
//! serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
//! ```
//!
//! #### To get started with Background Jobs, first you should define a job.
//! Jobs are a combination of the data required to perform an operation, and the logic of that
//! operation. They implment the `Job`, `serde::Serialize`, and `serde::DeserializeOwned`.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use anyhow::Error;
//! use background_jobs::Job;
//! use std::future::{ready, Ready};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
//! pub struct MyJob {
//!     some_usize: usize,
//!     other_usize: usize,
//! }
//!
//! impl MyJob {
//!     pub fn new(some_usize: usize, other_usize: usize) -> Self {
//!         MyJob {
//!             some_usize,
//!             other_usize,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Job for MyJob {
//!     type State = ();
//!     type Future = Ready<Result<(), Error>>;
//!
//!     const NAME: &'static str = "MyJob";
//!
//!     fn run(self, state: ()) -> Self::Future {
//!         info!("{}: args, {:?}", state.app_name, self);
//!
//!         ready(Ok(()))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The run method for a job takes an additional argument, which is the state the job expects to
//! use. The state for all jobs defined in an application must be the same. By default, the state
//! is an empty tuple, but it's likely you'll want to pass in some Actix address, or something
//! else.
//!
//! Let's re-define the job to care about some application state.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use anyhow::Error;
//! use background_jobs::Job;
//! use std::future::{ready, Ready};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug)]
//! pub struct MyState {
//!     pub app_name: String,
//! }
//!
//! impl MyState {
//!     pub fn new(app_name: &str) -> Self {
//!         MyState {
//!             app_name: app_name.to_owned(),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Job for MyJob {
//!     type State = MyState;
//!     type Future = Ready<Result<(), Error>>;
//!
//!     const NAME: &'static str = "MyJob";
//!
//!     fn run(self, state: MyState) -> Self::Future {
//!         info!("{}: args, {:?}", state.app_name, self);
//!
//!         ready(Ok(()))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Running jobs
//! By default, this crate ships with the `background-jobs-actix` feature enabled. This uses the
//! `background-jobs-actix` crate to spin up a Server and Workers, and provides a mechanism for
//! spawning new jobs.
//!
//! `background-jobs-actix` on it's own doesn't have a mechanism for storing worker state. This
//! can be implemented manually by implementing the `Storage` trait from `background-jobs-core`, or the provided in-memory store can be used.
//!
//! With that out of the way, back to the examples:
//!
//! ##### Main
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use anyhow::Error;
//! use background_jobs::{ServerConfig, memory_storage::Storage, WorkerConfig};
//!
//! #[actix_rt::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     // Set up our Storage
//!     let storage = Storage::new();
//!
//!     // Configure and start our workers
//!    let arbiter = Arbiter::new();
//!
//!    // Configure and start our workers
//!    let queue_handle =
//!        WorkerConfig::new_in_arbiter(arbiter.handle(), storage, |_| MyState::new("My App"))
//!            .register::<MyJob>()
//!            .set_worker_count(DEFAULT_QUEUE, 16)
//!            .start();
//!
//!     // Queue our jobs
//!     queue_handle.queue(MyJob::new(1, 2)).await?;
//!     queue_handle.queue(MyJob::new(3, 4)).await?;
//!     queue_handle.queue(MyJob::new(5, 6)).await?;
//!
//!     // Block on Actix
//!     actix_rt::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ##### Complete Example
//! For the complete example project, see
//! [the examples folder](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/background-jobs/src/branch/main/examples/actix-example)
//!
//! #### Bringing your own server/worker implementation
//! If you want to create your own jobs processor based on this idea, you can depend on the
//! `background-jobs-core` crate, which provides the Job trait, as well as some
//! other useful types for implementing a jobs processor and job store.
