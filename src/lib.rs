//! # Background Jobs
//!
//! This crate provides tooling required to run some processes asynchronously from a usually
//! synchronous application. The standard example of this is Web Services, where certain things
//! need to be processed, but processing them while a user is waiting for their browser to respond
//! might not be the best experience.
//!
//! ### Usage
//! #### Add Background Jobs to your project
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! background-jobs = "0.1"
//! failure = "0.1"
//! futures = "0.1"
//! tokio = "0.1"
//! ```
//! #### To get started with Background Jobs, first you should define a job.
//! Jobs are a combination of the data required to perform an operation, and the logic of that
//! operation. They implment the `Job`, `serde::Serialize`, and `serde::DeserializeOwned`.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! pub struct MyJob {
//!     some_usize: usize,
//!     other_usize: usize,
//! }
//!
//! impl MyJob {
//!     pub fn new(some_usize: usize, other_usize: usize) -> Self {
//!         MyJob {
//!             some_usize,
//!             other_usize,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Job for MyJob {
//!     fn run(self) -> Box<dyn Future<Item = (), Error = Error> + Send> {
//!         info!("args: {:?}", self);
//!
//!         Box::new(Ok(()).into_future())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Next, define a Processor.
//! Processors are types that define default attributes for jobs, as well as containing some logic
//! used internally to perform the job. Processors must implement `Proccessor` and `Clone`.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug)]
//! pub struct MyProcessor;
//!
//! impl Processor for MyProcessor {
//!     // The kind of job this processor should execute
//!     type Job = MyJob;
//!
//!     // The name of the processor. It is super important that each processor has a unique name,
//!     // because otherwise one processor will overwrite another processor when they're being
//!     // registered.
//!     fn name() -> &'static str {
//!         "MyProcessor"
//!     }
//!
//!     // The queue that this processor belongs to
//!     //
//!     // Workers have the option to subscribe to specific queues, so this is important to
//!     // determine which worker will call the processor
//!     //
//!     // Jobs can optionally override the queue they're spawned on
//!     fn queue() -> &'static str {
//!         DEFAULT_QUEUE
//!     }
//!
//!     // The number of times background-jobs should try to retry a job before giving up
//!     //
//!     // Jobs can optionally override this value
//!     fn max_retries() -> MaxRetries {
//!         MaxRetries::Count(1)
//!     }
//!
//!     // The logic to determine how often to retry this job if it fails
//!     //
//!     // Jobs can optionally override this value
//!     fn backoff_strategy() -> Backoff {
//!         Backoff::Exponential(2)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Running jobs
//! By default, this crate ships with the `background-jobs-server` feature enabled. This uses the
//! `background-jobs-server` crate to spin up a Server and Workers, and provides a mechanism for
//! spawning new jobs.
//!
//! ##### Starting the job server
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use background_jobs::ServerConfig;
//! use failure::Error;
//! use server_jobs_example::queue_set;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     // Run our job server
//!     tokio::run(ServerConfig::init(
//!         "127.0.0.1",
//!         5555,
//!         1,
//!         queue_set(),
//!         "example-db",
//!     ));
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! ##### Starting the job worker
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use background_jobs::WorkerConfig;
//! use failure::Error;
//! use server_jobs_example::{queue_map, MyProcessor};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     // Create the worker config
//!     let mut worker = WorkerConfig::new("localhost".to_owned(), 5555, queue_map());
//!
//!     // Register our processor
//!     worker.register_processor(MyProcessor);
//!
//!     // Spin up the workers
//!     tokio::run(worker.run());
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! ##### Queuing jobs
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use background_jobs::SpawnerConfig;
//! use futures::{future::lazy, Future};
//! use server_jobs_example::{MyJob, MyProcessor};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create 50 new jobs, each with two consecutive values of the fibonacci sequence
//!     let (_, _, jobs) = (1..50).fold((0, 1, Vec::new()), |(x, y, mut acc), _| {
//!         acc.push(MyJob::new(x, y));
//!
//!         (y, x + y, acc)
//!     });
//!
//!     // Create the spawner
//!     let spawner = SpawnerConfig::new("localhost", 5555);
//!
//!     // Queue each job
//!     tokio::run(lazy(move || {
//!         for job in jobs {
//!             tokio::spawn(spawner.queue::<MyProcessor>(job).map_err(|_| ()));
//!         }
//!
//!         Ok(())
//!     }));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to create your own jobs processor based on this idea, you can depend on the
//! `background-jobs-core` crate, which provides the LMDB storage, Processor and Job traits, as well as some
//! other useful types for implementing a jobs processor.

pub use background_jobs_core::{Backoff, Job, MaxRetries, Processor};

#[cfg(feature = "background-jobs-server")]
pub use background_jobs_server::{ServerConfig, SpawnerConfig, WorkerConfig};
