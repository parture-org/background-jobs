/// The SyncJob trait defines parameters pertaining to a synchronous instance of background job
///
/// This trait should be implemented sparingly, but is provided so that synchronous tasks may be
/// executed. If you have the ability to implement the
/// [`Job`](https://docs.rs/background-jobs/0.4.0/background_jobs/trait.Job.html) trait directly,
/// you should.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use background_jobs_server::SyncJob;
/// use failure::Error;
/// use log::info;
/// use serde_derive::{Deserialize, Serialize};
///
/// #[derive(Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
/// struct MyJob {
///     count: i32,
/// }
///
/// impl SyncJob for MyJob {
///     fn run(self, _state: ()) -> Result<(), Error> {
///         info!("Processing {}", self.count);
///
///         // Perform some synchronous operation, like a DB action with r2d2 and diesel
///
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let sync_job = MyJob { count: 0 };
///     let job = sync_job.to_job();
/// }
/// ```

    /// jobs, sending an email, shelling out (don't shell out), or doing otherwise lengthy
    /// processes, that logic should all be called from inside this method.
    ///
